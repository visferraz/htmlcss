<h2>
    No New Year's Day to celebrate<br/>
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away<br/>
No first of spring, no song to sing<br/>
In fact, here's just another ordinary day<br/>
No April rain, no flowers bloom<br/>
No wedding Saturday within the month of June<br/>
But what it is, is something true<br/>
Made up of these three words that I must say to you<br/>
I just called to say I love you<br/>
I just called to say how much I care<br/>
I just called to say I love you<br/>
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart<br/>
No summer's high, no warm July<br/>
No harvest moon to light one tender August night<br/>
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves<br/>
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies<br/>
No Libra sun, no Halloween<br/>
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring<br/>
But what it is, though old, so new<br/>
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do<br/>
I just called to say I love you<br/>
I just called to say how much I care, I do<br/>
I just called to say I love you<br/>
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart<br/>
I just called to say I love you<br/>
I just called to say how much I care, I do<br/>
I just called to say I love you<br/>
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart<br/>
Of my heart<br/>
Of my heart (baby, of my heart)<br/>
